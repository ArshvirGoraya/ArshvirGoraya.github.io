My Website/Portfolio. 

This is my first ever website. I learned CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Git in order to create this game developer portfolio and host it on GitHub Pages. 

### CONTENT:
Primarily, the website showcases projects I have worked on and provides information about them in their own individual pages. It also includes an about me section, a link to my resume and my contacts. It even has a small game made in JavaScript which visitors can play!

The website uses A LOT of transitions (e.g., colors, scaling, opacity, etc.) on pretty much all elements that the user can interact with. All this transition styling respects the different interaction styles: hover (from mouse), focus (potentially from the "tab" key), and touch (from mobile). 

The website uses  "hover: hover" media queries to apply hover and focus styles, and "hover: none" media queries inside JavaScript to apply touch styles. 

### USAGE: 
I mostly focused on developing for the desktop and mobile versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari. 

The website runs fine even with JavaScript disabled. Of course, it has less features in this case (e.g., the mini game is no longer playable and is simply disabled).
